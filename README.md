### Dev. Motivation
Although this is the terminal project of the course "Speech Compression", I thought that the teacher taught the the operation of command prompt with C/C++ and the use of **Portaudio + Libsndfile library**. It let me think of **"Command Prompt"** and **"Music"**. I have enthusiasm for game, and I was impressed with command prompt game in my childhood. So I want to develop a command prompt console game. Originally, I want to develop a big game, but there isn't enough time.

### Features

- With simple BGM and SFX in game.
  - using Portaudio + Libsndfile library
